# Satelite_Imagery
Deep Learning with Satellite Imagery
Developed a deep learning model in Python on Google Colab to analyze environmental impact in Ann Arbor using satellite imagery. Employed U-Net convolutional networks with focal loss and Jaccard Index evaluation for precise identification of changes in urban greenery, water bodies, and infrastructure.
Applied advanced image processing with OpenCV and dataset management for training-test splits, integrating MLOps using Weights \& Biases. Deployed prediction app on Hugging Face Space for real-time environmental change visualization.
